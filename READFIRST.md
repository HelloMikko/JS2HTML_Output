- Make sure you have an HTML file such as @index.html as seen next to the scraper.js file
- Code the HTML file however you want to call it to look
- Be sure in the scraper.js, that you change line 5 `text` to `text/html`. If you already see the `text/html` there, then don't worry about changing it, this is if your using a template or forked it from else where.
- Line 6, make sure your path to the HTML is on par meaning(be sure it is set correctly or it will break everything). So look for `./index.html` and change it too `./YOURFILE` unless its already set to `./index.html` <-- than leave it that way, just make sure you have a `index.html` or `filename.html` there.
